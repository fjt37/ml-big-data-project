# Bitcoin Projection

by Kenny Shu (qs76@cornell.edu) and Jay Tappen (fjt37@cornell.edu)

We would like to build a model to predict the value of bitcoin.

Possible questions:
 - What will the price be tomorrow?
 - Will the price go up or down today?
 - When will Bitcoin be worth $XXX
 - When will bitcoin as a currency have the same net worth as all USD, Euros, or Chinese Yuan, etc.
