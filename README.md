# Bitcoin Projection

by QiWen Shu (qs76@cornell.edu) and Jay Tappen (fjt37@cornell.edu)

We would like to build a model to predict the value of bitcoin, which we will define as its exchange rate to USD. We intend to use historical data about price and transaction rate, as well as metadata about the Bitcoin blockchain itself. With a model to predict the price, we can also answer other interesting questions such as when Bitcoin as a currency have the same net worth as all USD, Euros, or Chinese Yuan, etcetera. It may also be interesting to apply our models to other cryptocurrencies.
