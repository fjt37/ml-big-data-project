Historical Data
	- Raw features:
	 	- Price 
	 		- start with just this, and then maybe add more
	 	- Volume 
	 		- number of transactions
	 	- Bitcoin count 
	 		- number of bitcoins
	 	- Difficulty 
	 		- how hard it is to mine - a measure of number of miners
	 	- Hash rate
	 		- How many hashes are being computed by the mining community
	 		- Proportional to the number of miners, how much money they have invested in harware for mining
	 		- Inversely proportional to difficulty
	 	- Transactions per block 
	 		- mining rate is kept more or less constant, so this is a good measure of transaction rate
	 		- could be used instead of volume, depending on our timestep. Volume is better if using daily data
	 	- Transaction fee as percent
	 		- Like an interest rate on a credit card purchase
	 	- Number unique addresses
	 		- essentially the number of users
	 - Hierarchy of Features
	 	- Price
	 		- Volume
